# Symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic system using java
This project encrypts and decrypt files and whole folder files using AES for symmetric cryptograph and RSA for asymmetric cryptograph
## How to import project  
-	Download NetBeans 8.2 with JDK 
-	Go to file then import project choose from ZIP 
-	Choose CS433Project then click import 
# How to run project 
-	Go to source Packages >cs433project > CS433Project.java >run
# Use AES symmetric encrypt/decrypt file
-	put your file inside "AES Files" folder 
-	you will find your encrypt\decrypt file inside "AES Files"  folder after encrypt\decrypt successfully 
# Use RSA asymmetric encrypt\decrypt file
-	put your file inside "RSA Files" folder 
-	you will find your encrypt\decrypt file inside "RSA Files" folder after encrypt\decrypt successfully using public\private key inside "Keypair" folder
# Use AES symmetric encrypt/decrypt folder
-	encrypt\decrypt whole file inside "AES Files" folder
# Use RSA asymmetric encrypt\decrypt folder
-	encrypt\decrypt whole file inside "RSA Files" folder
